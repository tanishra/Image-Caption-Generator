## Description

This project implements an automated image captioning system using advanced machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for 
feature extraction, Vision Transformers (ViT) for spatial analysis, and attention mechanisms for focused text generation. It leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 
and transformers like GPT-2 to produce accurate captions from images. The system is trained on a large dataset of images with descriptions, demonstrating strong performance.
